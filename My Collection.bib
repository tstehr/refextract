While these warn- ings often appear in benign situations, they can also signal a man-in-the-middle attack. We conducted a survey of over 400 Internet users to examine their reactions to and understanding of current SSL warn- ings. We then designed two new warnings using warn- ings science principles and lessons learned from the survey. We evaluated warnings used in three pop- ular web browsers and our two warnings in a 100- participant, between-subjects laboratory study. Our warnings performed significantly better than exist- ing warnings, but far too many participants exhibited dangerous behavior in all warning conditions. Our re- sults suggest that, while warnings can be improved, a better approach may be to minimize the use of SSL warnings altogether by blocking users from making unsafe connections and eliminating warnings in be- nign situations.},

abstract = {The simplicity of HTTP made it the default building block for desktop and mobile apps, yet it suffers from inherent inefficiencies in the modern web. HTTP/2 was designed to address these inefficiencies and its adoption remarks a major protocol shift in the Internet. Despite this relevance, its Internet-wide adoption remains unknown. Especially, the adoption and use of server push - advertised as a key feature to further reduce page load times - is completely unexplored. To answer both questions, we provide large-scale measurements of the HTTP/2 adoption and usage of server push in the wild, probing the entire IPv4 address space and the complete set of.com/.net/.org domains. We find 5.38M HTTP/2 enabled domains hosted by only few infrastructures driving this adoption. While we find the overall HTTP/2 adoption to increase, only few hundred domains utilize server push. We examine pushed content, push strategies and identify the use of currently undocumented push strategies. Moreover, we discover large sources of overheads through server push for reoccurring page visits. By measuring page load times, we show that while push can speed up webpages, it also can slow them down - motivating the need for optimized push strategies.},

abstract = {As the web expands in size and adoption, so does the interest of attackers who seek to exploit web applications and exfiltrate user data. While there is a steady stream of news regarding major breaches and millions of user credentials compromised, it is logical to assume that, over time, the applications of the bigger players of the web are becoming more secure. However, as these applications become resistant to most prevalent attacks, adversaries may be tempted to move to easier, unprotected targets which still hold sensitive user data. In this paper, we report on the state of security for more than 22,000 websites that originate in 28 EU countries. We first explore the adoption of countermeasures that can be used to defend against common attacks and serve as indicators of "security consciousness". Moreover, we search for the presence of common vulnerabilities and weaknesses and, together with the adoption of defense mechanisms, use our findings to estimate the overall security of these websites. Among other results, we show how a website's popularity relates to the adoption of security defenses and we report on the discovery of three, previously unreported, attack variations that attackers could have used to attack millions of users. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

On the one hand, current practice is to resort to metrics, such as the document completion time (onLoad), that are simple to measure though knowingly inaccurate. On the other hand, there are metrics, like Google's SpeedIndex, that are better correlated with the actual user experience, but are quite complex to evaluate and, as such, relegated to lab experiments. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive state of the art on the metrics and tools available for WebQoE assessment. We then apply these metrics to a representative dataset (the Alexa top-100 webpages) to better illustrate their similarities, differences, advantages, and limitations. We next introduce novel metrics, inspired by Google's SpeedIndex, that offer significant advantages in terms of computational complexity, while maintaining a high correlation with the SpeedIndex. These properties make our proposed metrics highly relevant and of practical use.},

The average online shopper expects your pages to load in two seconds or less, down from four seconds in 2006; after three seconds, up to 40{\%} will abandon your site. i And performance pressure just keeps growing. To drive more sales and boost brand image, today's Websites are increasingly dependent on sophisticated technologies such as shopping tools, interactive games, and videos that attract attention, hold interest or move visitors toward your virtual shopping cart. But if the technology behind the marketing vision for your Website creates delays or fails to work properly, watch out — your visitors may quickly abandon your site and run to the competition. Gomez' own studies reveal that lack of visitor loyalty. By analyzing page abandonment data across more than 150 websites and 150 million page views, Gomez found that an increase in page response time from 2 to10 seconds increased page abandonment rates by 38{\%}. ii Page Response Time Drives An Increase In Page Abandonment The causes of Web dysfunction may be complex, but the lesson is simple: so-called " IT " issues that slow down your site can impact revenue, customer satisfaction and your brand — if they're not identified, monitored and resolved.

The role of a monitor is to observe each and every log entry, looking for suspicious certificates that interest the entity running the monitor. While anyone can run a monitor, it requires continuous operation and copies of the logs to be inspected. This has lead to the emergence of monitoring as-a-service: a trusted third-party runs the monitor and provides registered subjects with selective certificate notifications. We present a CT/bis extension for verifiable light-weight monitoring that enables subjects to verify the correctness of such certificate notifications, making it easier to distribute and reduce the trust which is otherwise placed in these monitors. Our extension supports verifiable monitoring of wild-card domains and piggybacks on CT's existing gossip-audit security model.},

abstract = {When browsers report TLS errors, they cannot distinguish between attacks and harmless server misconfigurations; hence they leave it to the user to decide whether continuing is safe. However, actual attacks remain rare. As a result, users quickly become used to "false positives" that deplete their attention span, making it unlikely that they will pay sufficient scrutiny when a real attack comes along. Consequently, browser vendors should aim to minimize the number of low-risk warnings they report. To guide that process, we perform a large-scale measurement study of common TLS warnings. Using a set of passive network monitors located at different sites, we identify the prevalence of warnings for a total population of about 300,000 users over a nine-month period. We identify low-risk scenarios that consume a large chunk of the user attention budget and make concrete recommendations to browser vendors that will help maintain user attention in high-risk situations. We study the impact on end users with a data set much larger in scale than the data sets used in previous TLS measurement studies. A key novelty of our approach involves the use of internal browser code instead of generic TLS libraries for analysis, providing more accurate and representative results.

abstract = {The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) due to its statelessness and lack of an authentication mechanism for verifying the identity of the sender has a long history of being prone to spoofing attacks. ARP spoofing is sometimes the starting point for more sophisticated LAN attacks like denial of service, man in the middle and session hijacking. The current methods of detection use a passive approach, monitoring the ARP traffic and looking for inconsistencies in the Ethernet to IP address mapping. The main drawback of the passive approach is the time lag between learning and detecting spoofing. This sometimes leads to the attack being discovered long after it has been orchestrated. In this paper, we present an active technique to detect ARP spoofing. We inject ARP request and TCP SYN packets into the network to probe for inconsistencies. This technique is faster, intelligent, scalable and more reliable in detecting attacks than the passive methods. It can also additionally detect the real mapping of MAC to IP addresses to a fair degree of accuracy in the event of an actual attack. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidolborg 2005.},

For video-streaming service, several analytical models have been proposed to estimate user opinion from buffering metrics. However, there remains the problem of estimating these buffering metrics from the limited set of measurements available on a per-connection basis for encrypted video services. In this paper, a system testbed is presented for automatically constructing a simple, albeit accurate, Quality-of-Experience (QoE) model for encrypted video-streaming services in a wireless network. The testbed consists of a terminal agent, a network-level emulator, and Probe software, which are used to compare end-user and network-level measurements. For illustration purposes, the testbed is used to derive the formulas to compute video performance metrics from TCP/IP metrics for encrypted YouTube traffic in a Wi-Fi network. The resulting formulas, which would be the core of a video-streaming QoE model, are also applicable to cellular networks, as the test campaign fully covers typical mobile network conditions and the formulas are partly validated in a real LTE network.},

abstract = {In conventional PKI, CAs are assumed to be fully trusted. However, in practice, CAs' absolute responsibility for providing trustworthiness caused major security and privacy issues. To prevent such issues, Google introduced the concept of Certificate Transparency (CT) in 2013. Later, several new PKI models are proposed to reduce the level of trust to the CAs. However, all of these proposals are still vulnerable to split-world attacks if the adversary is capable of showing different views of the log to the targeted victims. In this paper, we propose a new PKI architecture with certificate transparency based on blockchain, what we called CertLedger, to eliminate the split-world attacks and to provide certificate/revocation transparency. All TLS certificates' validation, storage, and entire revocation process is conducted in CertLedger as well as Trusted CA certificate management. During a TLS connection, TLS clients get an efficient proof of existence of the certificate directly from its domain owners. Hence, privacy is now perfectly preserved by eliminating the traceability issue via OCSP servers. It also provides a unique, efficient, and trustworthy certificate validation process eliminating the conventional inadequate and incompatible certificate validation processes implemented by different software vendors. TLS clients in CertLedger also do not require to make certificate validation and store the trusted CA certificates anymore. We analyze the security and performance of CertLedger and provide a comparison with the previous proposals. Finally, we implement its protoype on Ethereum to demonstrate experimental results. The results show that the performance of the TLS handshake and certificate validation through CertLedger is significantly improved compared to the current TLS protocol.},

abstract = {The popularity of “Trust-on-first-use” (Tofu) authentica- tion, used by SSH and HTTPS with self-signed certificates, demonstrates significant demand for host authentication that is low-cost and simple to deploy. While Tofu-based applications are a clear improvement over completely inse- cure protocols, they can leave users vulnerable to even simple network attacks. Our system, PERSPECTIVES, thwarts many of these attacks by using a collection of “no- tary” hosts that observes a server's public key via multiple network vantage points (detecting localized attacks) and keeps a record of the server's key over time (recognizing short-lived attacks). Clients can download these records on-demand and compare them against an unauthenticated key, detecting many common attacks. PERSPECTIVES ex- plores a promising part of the host authentication design space: Trust-on-first-use applications gain significant at- tack robustness without sacrificing their ease-of-use. We also analyze the security provided by PERSPECTIVES and describe our experience building and deploying a publicly available implementation.},

@article{Aumann2010,
abstract = {In the setting of secure multiparty computation, a set of mutually distrustful parties wish to securely compute some joint function of their private inputs. The computation should be carried out in a secure way, meaning that no coalition of corrupted parties should be able to learn more than specified or somehow cause the result to be "incorrect." Typically, corrupted parties are either assumed to be semi-honest (meaning that they follow the protocol specification) or malicious (meaning that they may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol). However, in many settings, the assumption regarding semi-honest behavior does not suffice and security in the presence of malicious adversaries is excessive and expensive to achieve. In this paper, we introduce the notion of covert adversaries, which we believe faithfully models the adversarial behavior in many commercial, political, and social settings. Covert adversaries have the property that they may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol specification in an attempt to cheat, but do not wish to be "caught" doing so. We provide a definition of security for covert adversaries and show that it is possible to obtain highly efficient protocols that are secure against such adversaries. We stress that in our definition, we quantify over all (possibly malicious) adversaries and do not assume that the adversary behaves in any particular way. Rather, we guarantee that if an adversary deviates from the protocol in a way that would enable it to "cheat" (meaning that it can achieve something that is impossible in an ideal model where a trusted party is used to compute the function), then the honest parties are guaranteed to detect this cheating with good probability. We argue that this level of security is sufficient in many settings. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Association for Cryptologic Research.},

abstract = {A PKI can be described as a set of technologies, procedures, and policies for propagating trust from where it initially exists to where it is needed for authentication in online environments. How the trust propagation takes place under a specific PKI depends on the PKI's syntactic trust structure, which is commonly known as a trust model. However, trust is primarily a semantic concept that cannot be expressed in syntactic terms alone. In order to define meaningful trust models for PKIs it is also necessary to consider the semantic assumptions and human cognition of trust relationships, as explicitly or implicitly expressed by certification policies, legal contractual agreements between participants in a PKI, and by how identity information is displayed and represented. Of the many different PKI trust models proposed in the literature, some have been implemented and are currently used in practical settings, from small personal networks to large-scale private and public networks such as the Internet. This chapter takes a closer look at the most prominent and widely used PKI trust models, and discusses related semantic issues.},

We develop and extend certificate transparency, a proposal in this direction, so that it efficiently handles certificate revocation. We show how this extension can be used to build a secure end-to-end email or messaging system using PKI with no requirement to trust certificate authorities, or to rely on complex peer-to-peer key-signing arrangements such as PGP. This makes end-to-end encrypted mail possible, with apparently few additional usability issues compared to unencrypted mail (specifically, users do not need to understand or concern themselves with keys or certificates). Underlying these ideas is a new attacker model appropriate for cloud computing, which we call " malicious-but-cautious " .},

Recent proposals using public logs have succeeded in making certificate management more transparent and verifiable. However, those proposals involve a fixed set of authorities. This means an oligopoly is created. Another problem with current log-based system is their heavy reliance on trusted parties that monitor the logs.

abstract = {Driven by CA compromises and the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, new security features have been added to TLS, HTTPS, and the web PKI over the past five years. These include Certificate Transparency (CT), for making the CA system auditable; HSTS and HPKP headers, to harden the HTTPS posture of a domain; the DNS-based extensions CAA and TLSA, for control over certificate issuance and pinning; and SCSV, for protocol downgrade protection. This paper presents the first large scale investigation of these improvements to the HTTPS ecosystem, explicitly accounting for their combined usage. In addition to collecting passive measurements at the Internet uplinks of large University networks on three continents, we perform the largest domain-based active Internet scan to date, covering 193M domains. Furthermore, we track the long-term deployment history of new TLS security features by leveraging passive observations dating back to 2012. We find that while deployment of new security features has picked up in general, only SCSV (49M domains) and CT (7M domains) have gained enough momentum to improve the overall security of HTTPS. Features with higher complexity, such as HPKP, are deployed scarcely and often incorrectly. Our empirical findings are placed in the context of risk, deployment effort, and benefit of these new technologies, and actionable steps for improvement are proposed. We cross-correlate use of features and find some techniques with significant correlation in deployment. We support reproducible research and publicly release data and code.},

abstract = {Transparency logs allow users to audit a potentially malicious service , paving the way towards a more accountable Internet. For example, Certificate Transparency (CT) enables domain owners to audit Certificate Authorities (CAs) and detect impersonation attacks. Yet, to achieve their full potential, transparency logs must be bandwidth-efficient when queried by users. Specifically, everyone should be able to efficiently look up log entries by their key and efficiently verify that the log remains append-only. Unfortunately , without additional trust assumptions, current transparency logs cannot provide both small-sized lookup proofs and small-sized append-only proofs. In fact, one of the proofs always requires band-width linear in the size of the log, making it expensive for everyone to query the log. In this paper, we address this gap with a new primitive called an append-only authenticated dictionary (AAD). Our construction is the first to achieve (poly)logarithmic size for both proof types and helps reduce bandwidth consumption in transparency logs. This comes at the cost of increased append times and high memory usage, both of which remain to be improved to make practical deployment possible.

In this paper, we shed light on the adoption patterns of Let's Encrypt "in the wild" and inform the future design and deployment of this exciting development in the security landscape. We analyze acquisition patterns of certificates as well as their usage and deployment trends in the real world. To this end, we analyze data from Certificate Transparency Logs containing records of more then 18 million certificates. We also leverage other sources like Censys, Alexa's historic records, Geolocation databases, and VirusTotal. We also perform active HTTPS measurements on the domains owning Let's Encrypt certificates. Our analysis of certificate acquisition shows that (1) the impact of Let's Encrypt is particularly visible in Western Europe; (2) Let's Encrypt has the potential to democratize HTTPS adoption in countries that are recent entrants to Internet adoption; (3) there is anecdotal evidence of popular domains quitting their previously untrustworthy or expensive CAs in order to transition to Let's Encrypt; and (4) there is a "heavy tailed" behavior where a small number of domains acquire a large number of certificates. With respect to usage, we find that: (1) only 54{\%} of domains actually use the Let's Encrypt certificates they have procured; (2) there are many non-trivial incidents of server misconfigurations; and (3) there is early evidence of use of Let's Encrypt certificates for typosquatting and for malware-laden sites.},

abstract = {We describe a new Schnorr-based multi-signature scheme (i.e., a protocol which allows a group of signers to produce a short, joint signature on a common message) called MuSig, provably secure under the Discrete Logarithm assumption and in the plain public-key model (meaning that signers are only required to have a public key, but do not have to prove knowledge of the private key corresponding to their public key to some certification authority or to other signers before engaging the protocol). MuSig improves over the state-of-art scheme of Bellare and Neven (ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security-CCS 2006) and its variants by Bagherzandi et al. (ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security-CCS 2008) and Ma et al. (Des Codes Cryptogr 54(2):121–133, 2010) in two respects: (i) it is simple and efficient, having the same key and signature size as standard Schnorr signatures; (ii) it allows key aggregation, which informally means that the joint signature can be verified exactly as a standard Schnorr signature with respect to a single “aggregated” public key which can be computed from the individual public keys of the signers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-signature scheme provably secure under the Discrete Logarithm assumption in the plain public-key model which allows key aggregation. As an application, we explain how our new multi-signature scheme could improve both performance and user privacy in Bitcoin.},

abstract = {Bias-resistant public randomness is a critical com- ponent in many (distributed) protocols. Generating public ran- domness is hard, however, because active adversaries may behave dishonestly to bias public random choices toward their advan- tage. Existing solutions do not scale to hundreds or thousands of participants, as is needed in many decentralized systems. We propose two large-scale distributed protocols, RandHound and RandHerd, which provide publicly-verifiable, unpredictable, and unbiasable randomness against Byzantine adversaries. Rand- Hound relies on an untrusted client to divide a set of randomness servers into groups for scalability, and it depends on the pigeon- hole principle to ensure output integrity, even for non-random, adversarial group choices. RandHerd implements an efficient, decentralized randomness beacon. RandHerd is structurally similar to a BFT protocol, but uses RandHound in a one-time setup to arrange participants into verifiably unbiased random secret-sharing groups, which then repeatedly produce random output at predefined intervals. Our prototype demonstrates that RandHound and RandHerd achieve good performance across hundreds of participants while retaining a low failure probability by properly selecting protocol parameters, such as a group size and secret-sharing threshold. For example, when sharding 512 nodes into groups of 32, our experiments show that RandHound can produce fresh random output after 240 seconds. RandHerd, after a setup phase of 260 seconds, is able to generate fresh random output in intervals of approximately 6 seconds. For this configuration, both protocols operate at a failure probability of at},

abstract = {Certificate Transparency (CT) is an emerging system for enabling the rapid discovery of malicious or misissued certificates. Initially standardized in 2013, CT is now finally beginning to see widespread support. Although CT provides desirable security benefits, web browsers cannot begin requiring all websites to support CT at once, due to the risk of breaking large numbers of websites. We discuss challenges for deployment, analyze the adoption of CT on the web, and measure the error rates experienced by users of the Google Chrome web browser. We find that CT has so far been widely adopted with minimal breakage and warnings. Security researchers often struggle with the tradeoff between security and user frustration: rolling out new security requirements often causes breakage. We view CT as a case study for deploying ecosystem-wide change while trying to minimize end user impact. We discuss the design properties of CT that made its success possible, as well as draw lessons from its risks and pitfalls that could be avoided in future large-scale security deployments.},

abstract = {An aggregate signature scheme is a digital signature that supports aggregation: Given n signatures on n distinct messages from n distinct users, it is possible to aggregate all these signatures into a single short signature. This single signature (and the n original messages) will convince the verifier that the n users did indeed sign the n original messages (i.e., user i signed message M i for i = 1,..., n). In this paper we introduce the concept of an aggregate signature, present security models for such signatures, and give several applications for aggregate signatures. We construct an efficient aggregate signature from a recent short signature scheme based on bilinear maps due to Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham. Aggregate signatures are useful for reducing the size of certificate chains (by aggregating all signatures in the chain) and for reducing message size in secure routing protocols such as SBGP. We also show that aggregate signatures give rise to verifiably encrypted signatures. Such signatures enable the verifier to test that a given ciphertext C is the encryption of a signature on a given message M. Verifiably encrypted signatures are used in contract-signing protocols. Finally, we show that similar ideas can be used to extend the short signature scheme to give simple ring signatures.},

abstract = {Since hundreds of certificate authorities (CAs) can issue browser-trusted certificates, it can be difficult for domain owners to detect certificates that have been fraudulently issued for their domain. Certificate Transparency (CT) is a recent standard by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that aims to construct public logs of all certificates issued by CAs, making it easier for domain owners to monitor for fraudulently issued certificates. To avoid relying on trusted log servers, CT includes mechanisms by which monitors and auditors can check whether logs are behaving honestly or not; these mechanisms are primarily based on Merkle tree hashing and authentication proofs. Given that CT is now being deployed, it is important to verify that it achieves its security goals. In this work, we define four security properties of logging schemes such as CT that can be assured via cryptographic means, and show that CT does achieve these security properties. We consider two classes of security goals: those involving security against a malicious logger attempting to present different views of the log to different parties or at different points in time, and those involving security against malicious monitors who attempt to frame an honest log for failing to include a certificate in the log. We show that Certificate Transparency satisfies these security properties under various assumptions on Merkle trees all of which reduce to collision resistance of the underlying hash function (and in one case with the additional assumption of unforgeable signatures).},

abstract = {Certificate Transparency (CT) was developed to mitigate shortcomings in the TLS/SSL landscape and to assess the trustworthi- ness of Certificate Authorities (CAs) and the certificates they create. With CT, certificates should be logged in public, audible, append-only CT logs and servers should provide clients (browsers) evidence, in the form of Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs), that the certificates that they present have been logged in credible CT logs. These SCTs can be delivered using three different methods: (i) X.509v3 extension, (ii) TLS extension, and (iii) OSCP stapling. In this paper, we develop a client-side measurement tool that implements all three methods and use the tool to analyze the SCT adoption among the one-million most popular web domains. Using two snapshots (from May and Oct. 2017), we answer a wide range of questions related to the delivery choices made by different domains, identify differences in the certificates used by these domains, the CT logs they use, and characterize the overheads and potential per- formance impact of the SCT delivery methods. By highlighting some of the tradeoffs between the methods and differences in the websites select- ing them, we provide insights into the current SCT adoption status and differences in how domains have gone upon adopting this new technology. 1},

abstract = {Certificate Transparency (CT) is a project that mandates public logging of TLS certificates issued by certificate authorities. While a CT log is designed to be trustless, it relies on the assumption that every client sees and cryptographically verifies the same log. The solution to this problem is a gossip mechanism that ensures that clients share the same view of the logs. Despite CT being added to Google Chrome, no gossip mechanism is pending wide deployment. We suggest an aggregation-based gossip mechanism that passively observes cryptographic material that CT logs emit in plaintext, aggregating at packet processors and periodically verifying log consistency off-path. Based on 20 days of RIPE Atlas measurements that represents clients from 3500 autonomous systems and 40{\%} of the IPv4 space, our proposal can be deployed incrementally for a realistic threat model with significant protection against undetected log misbehavior. We also discuss how to instantiate aggregation-based gossip on a variety of packet processors, and show that our P4 and XDP proof-of-concepts implementations run at line-speed.},

abstract = {The secret keys of critical network authorities - such as time, name, certificate, and software update services - represent high-value targets for hackers, criminals, and spy agencies wishing to use these keys secretly to compromise other hosts. To protect authorities and their clients proactively from undetected exploits and misuse, we introduce CoSi, a scalable witness cosigning protocol ensuring that every authoritative statement is validated and publicly logged by a diverse group of witnesses before any client will accept it. A statement S collectively signed by W witnesses assures clients that S has been seen, and not immediately found erroneous, by those W observers. Even if S is compromised in a fashion not readily detectable by the witnesses, CoSi still guarantees S's exposure to public scrutiny, forcing secrecy-minded attackers to risk that the compromise will soon be detected by one of the W witnesses. Because clients can verify collective signatures efficiently without communication, CoSi protects clients' privacy, and offers the first transparency mechanism effective against persistent man-in-the-middle attackers who control a victim's Internet access, the authority's secret key, and several witnesses' secret keys. CoSi builds on existing cryptographic multisignature methods, scaling them to support thousands of witnesses via signature aggregation over efficient communication trees. A working prototype demonstrates CoSi in the context of timestamping and logging authorities, enabling groups of over 8,000 distributed witnesses to cosign authoritative statements in under two seconds.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the evolution of Certificate Transparency (CT) over time and explore the implications of exposing certificate DNS names from the perspective of security and privacy. We find that certificates in CT logs have seen exponential growth. Website support for CT has also constantly increased, with now 33{\%} of established connections supporting CT. With the increasing deployment of CT, there are also concerns of information leakage due to all certificates being visible in CT logs. To understand this threat, we introduce a CT honeypot and show that data from CT logs is being used to identify targets for scanning campaigns only minutes after certificate issuance. We present and evaluate a methodology to learn and validate new subdomains from the vast number of domains extracted from CT logged certificates.},

Every time this sort of protocol is executed, the system degradates because of the threat of an eavesdropper listening in on the communication. Zero Knowl-edge Protocols, presented by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff, are an improvement on these situations. The objective is to obtain a system in which it is possible for a prover to convince a verifier of his knowledge of a certain secret without disclosing any information except the validity of his claim. This article will cover the basics of zero knowledge systems, explaining the main properties and characteristics. A series of examples, in growing level of difficulty, will also be presented, to see the main areas of application of such protocols.},

How much progress have we made toward this goal of widespread HTTPS adoption? We gather metrics to benchmark the status and progress of HTTPS adoption on the Web in 2017. To evaluate HTTPS adoption from a user perspective, we collect large-scale, aggregate user metrics from two major browsers (Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox). To measure HTTPS adoption from a Web developer per-spective, we survey server support for HTTPS among top and long-tail websites. We draw on these metrics to gain insight into the current state of the HTTPS ecosystem.},

abstract = {The level of trust accorded to certification author-ities has been decreasing over the last few years as several cases of misbehavior and compromise have been observed. Log-based approaches, such as Certificate Transparency, ensure that fraudulent TLS certificates become publicly visible. However, a key element that log-based approaches still lack is a way for clients to verify that the log behaves in a consistent and honest manner. This task is challenging due to privacy, efficiency, and deployability reasons. In this paper, we propose the first (to the best of our knowledge) gossip protocols that enable the detection of log inconsistencies. We analyze these protocols and present the results of a simulation based on real Internet traffic traces. We also give a deployment plan, discuss technical issues, and present an implementation.},
