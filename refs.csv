ROUTINES TO GENERATE TRAPDOOR KNAPSACKS 1* General Comments: The following routines have been written in PC, a simplified version of C that does indefinite precision integer arithmetic. BC runs on a PDP-11 under the Unix operating system. BC has a few peculiar conventions as follows: % The infix mod operator. w'Xm computes w modulo m. auto A local variable declaration. ++ The unary increment-by-one operator. As a postfix operator, it first returns the value of a variable, then increments it. As a prefix operator, it increments a variable and returns the incremented value. Same as ++, only it decrements. != The relational not-equal operator. 0!=1 is true, but O!=O is false. "" "" The relational equal operator: 0==0 is true. The indicated string is printed, no print or output"

430,Prins2011,"J.R. Prins. DigiNotar Certificate Authority breach “Operation Black Tulip”. Technical Report, Fox-IT, Delft, 2011.",What is the scope and status of the breach? - Have other DigiNotar CA environments been breached? - Do we still see hacker activity on the network of DigiNotar? - Are rogue certificates actively being used by hackers?
431,Prins2011,"J.R. Prins. DigiNotar Certificate Authority breach “Operation Black Tulip”. Technical Report, Fox-IT, Delft, 2011.","Can we discover anything about the impact of the incident? - What certificates were issued without knowledge of DigiNotar? - What other (rogue) certificates might have been generated? - How many rogue connections were made using rogue certificates? - What was the nature of these connections? In order to address these questions we (basically) (i) implemented specialized monitoring to be able to detect, analyse and follow up on active misuse, and (ii) analysed digital traces on hard disks, and in databases and log files to investigate the origin and impact of the breach. 1 Revoked: A certificate is irreversibly revoked if, for example, it is discovered that the certificate authority (CA) had improperly issued a certificate, or if a private-key is thought to have been compromised. Certificates may also be revoked for failure of the identified entity to adhere to policy requirements such as publication of false documents, mis-representation of software behavior, or violation of any other policy specified by the CA operator or its customer. The most common reason for revocation is the user no longer being in sole possession of the private key (e.g., the token containing the private key has been lost or stolen). 1.3 This report The goal of this report is to share relevant information with DigiNotar stakeholders (such as the Dutch Government and the Internet community), based on which they can make their own risk analysis. Because this is a public report, some investigation results and details cannot be included for privacy and/ or security reasons. Since the investigation has been more of a fact finding mission thus far, we will not draw any conclusions with regards to the network-setup and the security management system. In this report we will not give any advice to improve the technical infrastructure for the long term. Our role is to investigate the incident and give a summary of our findings until now. We leave it to the reader in general and other responsible"
432,Prins2011,"J.R. Prins. DigiNotar Certificate Authority breach “Operation Black Tulip”. Technical Report, Fox-IT, Delft, 2011.","1 Skills and goal of the hackers We found that the hackers were active for a longer period of time. They used both known hacker tools as well as software and scripts developed specifically for this task. Some of the software gives an amateurish impression, while some scripts, on the other hand, are very advanced. In at least one script, fingerprints from the hacker are left on purpose, which were also found in the Comodo breach investigation of March 2011. Parts of the log files, which would reveal more about the creation of the signatures, have been deleted. The list of domains and the fact that 99% of the users are in Iran suggest that the objective of the hackers is to intercept private communications in Iran. 4.2 Other possible rogue certificates Using the OCSP responder requests we verify if the requested serial belongs to a known certificate. We have seen requests for unknown serials that cannot be matched against a known certificate. It‟s possible that these serials belong to a “rogue” certiticate or are just bogus OCSP requests, for instance done by security researchers. It‟s still possible other unknown10 rogue certificates have been produced. OCSP logging could still catch other possible rogue certificates based on the number of requests for an unknown serial, although it‟s difficult to match the common name with that serial if the certificate in question is not known. 4.3 Trust in the PKIoverheid and Qualified environment Although all CA-servers have been accessed by a hacker with full administrative access rights and attempts have been made to use the running PKI-software we have no proof of generated rogue Qualified or PKIoverheid certificates. The log files of these CA-Servers validate as correct and no deleted log files have been found on these CA-servers. This is in contrast to our findings on the other breached CA servers. Investigators encountered two (2) serial numbers of certificates on the Qualified or PKIoverheid server"

A Yao’s Protocol for Semi-Honest Adversaries We now describe Yao’s protocol for secure two-party computation (in the presence of semi-honest adversaries) which is proven secure in [24]. Yao’s protocol is based on the following “garbled-circuit” construction. The garbled circuit construction. Let C be a Boolean circuit that receives two inputs x1, x2 ∈ {0, 1}n and outputs C(x1, x2) ∈ {0, 1}n (for simplicity in this description, we assume that the input length, output length and the security parameter are all of the same length n). We also assume that C has the property that if a circuit-output wire comes from a gate g, then gate g has no wires that are input to other gates.13 (Likewise, if a circuit-input wire is itself also a circuit-output, then it is not input into any gate.) The reduction uses a private key encryption scheme (G, E, D) that has indistinguishable encryptions for multiple messages, and also a special property called an elusive efficiently verifiable range; see [24].14 We begin by describing the construction of a single garbled gate g in C. The circuit C is Boolean, and therefore any gate is represented by a function g : {0, 1} × {0, 1} → {0, 1}. Now, let the two input wires to g be labelled w1 and w2, and let the output wire from g be labelled w3. Furthermore, let k0 1, k1 1, k0 2, k1 2, k0 3, k1 3 be six keys obtained by independently invoking the keygeneration algorithm G(1n); for simplicity, assume that these keys are also of length n.

Let G(·) be a randomized polynomial algorithm with input a security parameter λ. Then, ⟨G, GT ,p,д,e⟩ ← G(1λ ) are called bilinear pairing parameters if G and GT are cyclic groups of prime order p where discrete log is hard, G = ⟨д⟩ (i.e., G has generator д) and if e is a bilinear map, e : G × G → GT such that GT = ⟨e(д,д)⟩. Our security analysis utilizes the following two cryptographic assumptions over elliptic curve groups with bilinear pairings. Definition A.2 (q-SBDH Assumption). Given security parameter λ, bilinear pairing parameters ⟨G, GT ,p,д,e⟩ ← G(1λ ), public parameters ⟨д,дs ,дs2 , . . . ,дsq ⟩ for some q = poly(λ) and some s chosen uniformly at random from Z∗ p, no probabilistic polynomialtime adversary can output a pair ⟨c,e(д,д) 1 s+c ⟩ for some c ∈ Zp, except with probability negligible in λ.

I need you to read this Institutional Review Board consent form. <hand form and pen>. Read carefully and sign. If you have any questions let me know. You are about to participate in a study about two different methods of deploying HTTPS. You will be acquiring a certificate and configuring a web server to serve HTTPS in two different ways. One way will be using software from Let’s Encrypt, and the in the other way you will be purchasing a certificate from a certificate authority and configuring the web server by hand. After the study you will be asked some questions about your experience, and fill out a survey. Any credentials, methods of payment, or other necessary information will be provided to you on these sheets <gesture to info sheets>, one for each method of HTTPS deployment <note differences between sheets>. The domains you will acquire a certificate for have already been purchased and registered to point to the provided server. The server software is Apache, and it has already been installed on the server. The server firewall is already disabled. An email address and password will be provided, but for any task that requires you to create a password, feel free to come up with your own. I can reset the account later if necessary. For the phase where a payment method is required, you can use the provided card as if it were a credit card, using the payment info provided. The terminal is already connected to the server via SSH. You should not need any additional materials or information to complete the task. Imagine you’re at home or work, and do whatever you would normally do to complete the task, including performing web searches, calling a friend, etc. During the study I will be unable to answer any questions, and will respond with ‘do whatever you think you need to do to complete the task.’ During the study I ask that you refrain from using your cell phone to take calls.

Researchers have also begun to reveal the extent to which CAs have turned over the cryptographic keys to the kingdom by delegating chains of trust to others.2 Constrainability As it stands, nearly every user of a given software package trusts the same list of root CAs, and they trust each of them with the ability to authenticate any website. For instance, no practical means exists for users to restrict the CA of a national government to issue certificates only for entities within its borders. RFC 5280 includes optional “name constraints” that would limit the domains for which a given CA can issue certificates.1 However, this feature remains largely unsupported. Trust Agility Over time, new facts emerge that change the assessment of CA trustworthiness. In current software, however, the list of root CAs resembles a write-only data structure in which"

Chapter 2 Fault-Tolerance & Paxos How do you create a fault-tolerant distributed system? In this chapter we start out with simple questions, and, step by step, improve our solutions until we arrive at a system that works even under adverse circumstances, Paxos. 2.1 Client/Server Definition 2.1 (node). We call a single actor in the system node. In a computer network the computers are the nodes, in the classical client-server model both the server and the client are nodes, and so on. If not stated otherwise, the total number of nodes in the system is n. Model 2.2 (message passing). In the message passing model we study distributed systems that consist of a set of nodes. Each node can perform local computations, and can send messages to every other node. Remarks: • We start with two nodes, the smallest number of nodes in a distributed system. We have a client node that wants to “manipulate” data (e.g., store, update, . . . ) on a remote"

Lamport described the algorithm as the solution to a problem of the parliament of a fictitious Greek society on the island Paxos. He even liked this idea so much, that he gave some lectures in the persona of an Indiana-Jones-style archaeologist! When the paper was submitted, many readers were so distracted by the descriptions of the activities of the legislators, they did not understand the meaning and purpose of the algorithm. The paper was rejected. But Lamport refused to rewrite the paper, and he later wrote that he “was quite annoyed at how humorless everyone working in the field seemed to be”. A few years later, when the need for a protocol like Paxos arose again, Lamport simply took the paper out of the drawer and gave it to his colleagues. They liked it. So Lamport decided to submit the paper (in basically unaltered form!) again, 8 years after he wrote it – and it got accepted! But as this paper"

Chapter 4 Byzantine Agreement In order to make flying safer, researchers studied possible failures of various sensors and machines used in airplanes. While trying to model the failures, they were confronted with the following problem: Failing machines did not just crash, instead they sometimes showed arbitrary behavior before stopping completely. With these insights researchers modeled failures as arbitrary failures, not restricted to any patterns. Definition 4.1 (Byzantine). A node which can have arbitrary behavior is called byzantine. This includes “anything imaginable”, e.g., not sending any messages at all, or sending different and wrong messages to different neighbors, or lying about the input value. Remarks: • Byzantine behavior also includes collusion, i.e., all byzantine nodes are being controlled by the same adversary. • We assume that any two nodes communicate directly, and that no node can forge an incorrect sender address. This is a requirement, such that a single byzantine node cannot simply impersonate all nodes! • We call non-byzantine nodes correct nodes."

In: USENIX ATC (2008) A Implementation Below implementation details are provided for CT-over-DNS as the aggregated plaintext source. However, most of the discussion is not only relevant for DNS. A.1 Plaintext Source Aggregation-based gossip relies on a plaintext source that packet processors can observe. The most applicable mechanism today is CT-over-DNS, which is hosted by Google for all Chrome-included logs. According to the draft by Laurie [30], a DNS STH response is an IN TXT resource record where the query domain is sth.<log>.ct.googleapis.com. We further restrict the format such that a response must be transported by UDP and contain (i) a single query, (ii) a single response, and (iii) no more than a threshold of bytes. It is hard to process a TCP data stream because it may span multiple IP packets.17 At best, it is also hard to parse variable-length and human-readable protocols such as HTTP.18 From a general standpoint, this means that neither TLS ≤ 1.2 nor OCSP are particularly prominent sources to aggregate despite STHs being transferred in plaintext [13].

Technical Report, Google, 2017.","Verifying that for each SCT issued, the appropriate entry is in the log (i.e. the certificate + timestamp). Generally, to ensure consistent view, clients have to check consistency between STHs and should share the STHs observed with other clients. However, Chrome clients do not need to do either as all clients will receive the same STHs from Google via the component updater (the updates are signed). The threat of Google’s STH distribution mechanism being compromised (by an attacker who was also able to compromise a log) is not mitigated by clients checking consistency proofs as the attacker could equally change Chrome’s behaviour (in the same way an attacker could prevent gossiping of such STHs). Verification of inclusion of issued SCTs (and the certificates they were issued for) will be done by each Chrome client. Issuance of an SCT without inclusion of the right entry (in time) should be rare enough to be considered a security incident and reported in the same manner that invalid certificates are reported. Before that can happen we will measure how often clients fail to obtain proofs of inclusion (and for how long) so as to not falsely report such SCTs and only make a decision on reporting SCTs once we have strong confidence that these are security incidents. Possible Performance Impact Note that the process of validating STHs and fetching inclusion proofs is asynchronous and is independent from any certificate validation or any other networking operation. All operations would be done in the background at a low priority. CPU Consumption: The additional operations are verifying ECDSA signatures for each new STH. This is negligible given it is performed roughly once every 24 hours. Network overhead: Each client would receive a component update containing ~10 STHs. Assuming ~240 bytes per STH, that would amount to ~2.4k received once (on average) a"

A Security Model and Proof Details Below we give a formalization of the definition of a CT log that has been modified to include our additional requirements. Definition 3 (CT Log). A CT log is an entity that maintains append-only lists Log, hashLog, ILog, and TLog as well as 4 signing keys kH, kT , kI, kS and a counter i. A CT log’s lists are initially empty, and the counter is initially set to 0. It also has access to poly(λ)near collision resistant hash function H, a signature scheme σ = (KeyGen0 , Sign0 , Verify0 ) , and another signature scheme σk = (KeyGen, Sign, Verify) with efficient proof of knowledge properties (as in Definition 1). Upon receiving a message m, t from party P, a log forms the SCT s = (m, t) and takes the following actions1: – send P (H(s), SignkH (H(s))) – send P (t + H(s), SignkT"
