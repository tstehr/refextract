# Reference Extraction and Backwards Search

Find papers that are referenced by many of your sources to get a set of basic literature. See the "Backward Search" section of [our paper](http://www.inform.nu/Articles/Vol23/ISJV23p077-087Schumann5990.pdf) for a detailed explanation of the method.

The input file (`My Collection.bib`) is exported from Mendeley. Other BibTeX editors may need code adjustment.
